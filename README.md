# pick

![pick(1) usage](screencast.gif)

[pick(1)][pick]
reads a list of choices from `stdin` and outputs the selected choice to
`stdout`.
Therefore it is easily used both in pipelines and subshells:

```sh
# Select a file in the current directory to open using xdg-open(1):
$ find . -type f | pick | xargs xdg-open
# Select a command from the history to execute:
$ eval $(fc -ln 1 | pick)
```

[pick(1)][pick] can also be used from within Vim,
see the
[pick.vim][pick-vim]
plugin.
