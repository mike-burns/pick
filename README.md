## Usage

`pick(1)` reads a list of choices on `stdin` and outputs the selected choice on
`stdout`. Therefore it is easily used both in pipelines and subshells:

```sh
git ls-files | pick | xargs less # Select a file in the current git repository to view in less
cd $(find . -type d | pick)      # Select a directory to cd into
```

Pick can also easily be used from within Vim both using `system()` and `!`. For
ready-to-map functions, see [the pick.vim Vim plugin]. For examples of how to
call `pick(1)` from within Vim, see [the pick.vim source code].

***Please note:*** pick requires a fully functional terminal to run and
therefore cannot be run from within gvim or MacVim.

See the `pick(1)` man page for detailed usage instructions and more examples.
